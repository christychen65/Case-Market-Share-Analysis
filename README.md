# Case-Market-Share-Analysis
The data, content, and final delivery I shared on GitHub utilize mock-up data due to confidentiality. This work sample aims to demonstrate my analytical skills, problem-solving approach, and the lessons I learned from the case.

### 1. Introduction
This case revolves around XYZ, a prominent big box store chain operating across various locations in Canada. The analysis will provide insights for developing a company strategy for the upcoming year. To guide the decision-making process, the CEO emphasizes the importance of quantitative evidence and data-driven analysis. The case presents key questions related to market share, sales performance, customer satisfaction, competitor dynamics, investment opportunities, and real estate plans. By conducting a thorough analysis and providing recommendations supported by numerical calculations, the goal is to formulate a comprehensive strategy that ensures the company's growth and success in the competitive retail market.

The objective of this case study is to develop a comprehensive company strategy. The CEO has raised several key questions and is looking for data-driven analysis supported by quantitative evidence to make informed decisions. The goal is to address market share, sales performance, customer satisfaction, competitor dynamics, investment opportunities, and real estate plans. The analysis should provide recommendations backed by numerical calculations and facts to guide Big Buy's strategic direction for the upcoming year.

<br />
Our analysis will also address the following questions as requested:<br />
<br />
1) What is XYZ’s Grocery market share? What is the XYZ’s Home Improvement market share?<br />
2) What is XYZ’s overall market share? <br />
3) What are the average sales per store for XYZ and its competitors?
4) XYZ can invest $3M in marketing and sales to grow either Apparel & footwear sales or Home improvement sales by 0.5% in the coming year. What should XYZ do: invest in Apparel & footwear, invest in Home Improvement, or no investment at all.<br />
5) SC Super Center, one of the major competitors of XYZ who sells all product categories that XYZ sells, has announced it will be closing ALL of their 50 stores in Canada next year to focus on their E-commerce business. Calculate their expected market share loss (noting any assumptions). Will this have any impact on XYZ? If so, calculate how much this will impact XYZ’s sales (in $). What other implications are there?<br />
6) To help evaluate current customer satisfaction, we launched a quick survey to see how customers score XYZ on 3 different dimensions. Based on the data collected, what do consumers think of XYZ? What are the implications? <br />
